# API_to_SQL_pipeline
This project demonstrates a data pipeline that extracts data from a public API, transforms it as needed, and loads it into a SQL database (ETL process). It automates the workflow of collecting external data (like weather, news, or stock prices) and storing it for further analysis or dashboarding.
